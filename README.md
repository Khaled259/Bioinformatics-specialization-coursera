This repository serves as a personal portfolio of my work completing the **[Bioinformatics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics)** offered by the University of California San Diego on Coursera. It contains my code implementations for the Honors Track ("hacker track") programming challenges, notes on key algorithms, and solutions to various problems presented throughout the 7-course series.

## About the Specialization

This is a rigorous, 7-course specialization taught by leading pioneers in the field, including Pavel Pevzner and Phillip Compeau. It provides a deep dive into the computational challenges of modern biology. I learned how to sequence and compare genomes, find disease-causing mutations, and build an evolutionary "Tree of Life."

## Skills Gained

Throughout this journey, I have developed and solidified my skills in:

*   **Algorithmic Thinking:** Designing and implementing algorithms for analyzing DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.
*   **Core Bioinformatics Concepts:**
    *   DNA Replication & Transcription
    *   Genome Sequencing (De Bruijn Graphs, Eulerian Paths)
    *   Sequence Alignment (Dynamic Programming)
    *   Molecular Evolution & Phylogenetic Trees
    *   Clustering Algorithms for Genomic Data
    *   Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for gene finding
*   **Programming:** Solving complex problems, primarily using [**Python/R/Your Language**].
*   **Problem Solving:** Translating biological problems into computational models and finding efficient solutions.
